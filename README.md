# Code 301: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Code 301! This is a class that builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of a Code 401 class.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure of the course is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC), which is a common design pattern for web applications.

The course is broken down into 4 modules:
- Module 1: Frontend Application Development
- Module 2: Backend Application Development
- Module 3: Full Stack Application Development and ReactJS
- Module 4: Projects

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in Canvas.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade Git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core Git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.

## Assignments, Deadlines, Late Work, and other fun things
There are several types of assignments that are required for this course, and they have different policies on late work.  We'll discuss these during the course kickoff.

#### Graded out of points
All assignments graded out of a number of points lose 20% automatically for late submissions. (Resubmits after an on-time submission do not incur this penalty.)
