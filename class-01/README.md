# Class 01: SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Overview

Today we will be covering some new topics and reviewing concepts you should already be familiar with. Our main goal is to discuss the "what", "why", and "how" to implement modern responsive development techniques into your CSS coding practices.

We will also spend some time preparing you to work with the newest iteration of JS, ES6. This is includes several new and very important topics, including `let`, `const`, `this`, and the `new` keyword.
